Name: "CheckConnectivity"
Title: "Test connectivity between two interfaces"
Abstract: "This workflow aims to test the connectivity between two interfaces. It returns the status of the connection, true or false."
Description: >
    # How to use:
      1. Select the Source and Destination Nodes to check the Connectivity between them
      2. Hit the 'Execute' button to run the workflow
      3. Result will be shown as status true or false along with flows between those interfaces
    # How It Works:
      1. It will start capture on all Nodes from Source to Destination and injects 5 ICMP-Pkts from Source to Destination
      2. After 1 sec it will check for flows having the same capture-id created by this workflow
      3. If flows are there and the BA-Packtes in flow-metric > 0, then return 'Connectivity = ture' else 'Connectivity = false', along with this it also returns the flows

Parameters:
  - Name: source
    Description: Source node
    Type: node
  - Name: destination
    Description: Destination node
    Type: node
